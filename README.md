# image-clustering-and-rotation-search
- clusters similar images and searches disoriented images and matches it with original image.
- clustering is based on modified form of hierarichal clustering that calculates distance based on a very uniqie formula.
- projectII.ipynb file basically compares the probability of all the rotated images using CNN then tells it's correct orientation.
